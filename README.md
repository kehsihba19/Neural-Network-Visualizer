Visualization of handwritten digit classification 

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://bit.ly/mnist-visualisation)

#### • Classification of handwritten digit dataset using Keras functional API and Tensorflow.
#### • API call to fetch saved models report using Flask.
#### • Visualization of different neural network layers and prediction using Streamlit package.

## Installation
